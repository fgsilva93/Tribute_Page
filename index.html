          <h3>Some Interesting Facts about about Space:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>It's completely slient, Sound waves need a medium to travel through and since there is no atmosphere in the vacuum of space, which results in no noise. </li> 
            <li>In space, if two pieces of the same type of metal touch in space, they will bond and be permanently stuck together. This is called cold welding.</li>
            <li>The temperature in the void of space is about −270.45 °C.</li>
            <li>The universe is observed to be 13.8 billion years old and has been expanding since its formation in the Big Bang.</li>
            <li>The space between galaxies is not completely empty but has an average of one atom per cubic meter.</li>
            <li>Spacecraft have visited all the known planets in our solar system.</li>
            <li>Our galaxy will collide with Andromeda Galaxy in about 5 billion years. Some astronomers refer to our two galaxy as a binary system of giant spirals.</li>
            <li>Most meteor showers are caused by debris from comets. When Earth moves through those debris trails, we see increased numbers of comets.</li>
            <li>The Sun weighs about 330,000 times more than Earth.</li>
            <li>Uranus’ blue glow is due to the gases in its atmosphere. The methane in Uranus’ upper atmosphere filters out all the red light from the Sun but reflects the Sun’s blue light back into space, giving it its blue appearance.</li>
            <li>There are 10 times more stars in the night sky than grains of sand on the Earth, with 70 sextillion stars being visible from Earth through a telescope.</li>
            <li>Any free-moving liquid in outer space will form itself into a sphere because of something called surface tension, which is an imbalance of intermolecular attractive forces.</li>
          </ul>
